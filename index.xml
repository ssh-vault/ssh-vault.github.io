      <description>What is ssh-vault? A command line tool (cli) for creating encrypted files &amp;ldquo;vaults&amp;rdquo; using ssh rsa keys for encrypt/decrypt.
A vault password is encrypted using the public ssh key of the receiver and the main data of the vault using AES256, in order to see/decrypt the vault contents, the receiver will need to use his private key &amp;amp; password in case of needed to be available to edit/view the contents.</description>

      <description>ssh-vault will randomly create a password and use it for encrypting the contents of the vault using a symmetric cipher AES256, the password later will be encrypted using the ssh-rsa public key of the receiver.

 This simplify the share of sensitive data across developers, teams, or either to store things on a public repository by just using ssh keys.
The option -u username will fetch the receiver ssh-rsa public from github:</description>

      <description>-u  The option -u is used for fetching the ssh-rsa public keys, when passing a username for example:
$ ssh-vault -u alice  It will try to fetch the keys from github.com.
-u https://&amp;hellip; In case the keys are not in github, and url can be passed, for example:
$ ssh-vault -u https://launchpad.net/~user/+sshkeys  Using gitlab:
$ ssh-vault -u https://gitlab.com/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;.keys  -k N There may be cases where the user has more than one key in this keys the option -k helps to specify what key to use, for example if we want to send something to user bob using his second key, this would be used:</description>

      <description>SSH key fingerprint ssh-vault can be used to print the ssh key fingerprint compatible with the format that AWS uses.
To get the fingerprint for the key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:
$ ssh-vault -f  For example to get the fingerprint for user Bob this could be used:
$ ssh-vault -u bob -f 24:c6:6f:33:49:de:d7:bb:77:cf:e9:78:4c:e9:25:5f  Using -u for remote server:
$ ssh-vault -u https://gitlab.com/bob.keys -f f8:33:95:0e:6e:35:93:39:18:cf:af:0d:34:5a:34:df  Or for a key that locally stored:</description>

      <title>Create vault from stdin</title>
      <link>https://ssh-vault.com/post/create-vault-from-stdin/</link>

      <description>ssh-vault can read from standard input (stdin) when creating a vault.
Instead of creating a vault from scratch, a vault can be created by using an existing file, for example if Alice wants to send a file to Bob she could so something like:
cat /path/to/file | ssh-vault -u bob create bobs.vault   you can choose any name you want for the vault, in this example the vault contents will be written to file bobs.</description>

      <description>An approach for sharing a vault across a team would be:
 ssh-vault is not properly designed for group/broadcast encryption, therefore, this approach may not be the best depending on your security requirements.
 Have each group member own a public/private key pair.
Make a new group key pair and send it to each member within a vault.
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &amp;quot;group@acme.tld&amp;quot;  Send the key pair to each member in a secure way:</description>

      <description>encrypt For sending/sharing a &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; without knowing the receiver keys you could use the option -u new, example:
echo &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; | ssh-vault -u new create  Or:
ssh-vault -u new create  The new key will create new pair of ssh keys (prublic/priate) using the service https://ssh-keys.online/new.
You could create and user your own private server that generates ssh keys just need to pass the url to the -u option, for example:</description>
